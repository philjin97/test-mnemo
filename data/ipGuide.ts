      title: "Project Mnemo: Overview",
      content: `
  Project Mnemo is a visionary initiative aiming to bridge human creativity with AI-driven asset generation. 
  At its core, Mnemo is about remembering — recollecting forgotten styles, reconstructing fragmented worlds, 
  and reimagining lost futures through curated artistic assets.
  
  The platform empowers storytellers, game developers, filmmakers, and marketing teams to access a living library of visuals, 
  music, and code that dynamically adapts to narrative prompts and creative briefs. 
  Mnemo believes that every project deserves a soul, and it provides the building blocks for breathing life into ideas.
  
  Phase I focuses on memory reconstruction through curated asset recommendations based on AI interpretation of input prompts.
  Future phases will integrate real-time collaborative creation and adaptive memory evolution over multiple sessions.

      title: "Narrative Worldbuilding Guidelines",
      content: `
  The Mnemo universe takes place after "The Shatter" — a cosmic memory fragmentation event that erased most of Earth's historical record. 
  Survivors rebuild civilization by piecing together distorted fragments of cultural memories, stored within synthetic archives.
  
  World elements should feel both familiar and alien. Visual designs combine ancient relics, dreamscapes, cybernetic ruins, and glitching artifacts.
  Key narrative motifs include:
  - The struggle between authentic and synthetic memory.
  - Exploration of identity in a world built on imperfect recollections.
  - Resistance against "Memory Lords" who control access to lost histories.
  
  Tone: somber yet resilient, surreal but emotionally grounded.

      title: "Visual Art Direction",
      content: `
  Visual materials should evoke a dreamlike state, blending organic forms with synthetic textures. 
  Use deep shadows, fractured light beams, neon glows, and biological irregularities combined with mechanical precision.
  
  Color Palette:
  - Primary: Emerald Green (#00FFB2), Neon Violet (#9D00FF), Midnight Black (#0B0B0D)
  - Secondary: Rust Orange (#D95D39), Ghost White (#F5F5F5)
  
  Visual inspirations: Dali's melting landscapes, Moebius's intricate futurism, cyberpunk cityscapes decayed by memory loss.

      title: "Music Atmosphere Guidelines",
      content: `
  Music assets should carry emotional weight while embracing technological imperfection.
  
  Desired atmospheres:
  - Distant echoes through abandoned corridors
  - Artificial heartbeats signaling life within decay
  - Nostalgic synth melodies corrupted by data loss
  - Ethereal choirs emerging from sonic haze
  
  BPMs typically range between 70-130 depending on scene urgency.
  Preferred genres include ambient electronic, synthwave, dystopian orchestral hybrids, and glitch-hop.
